        "detail2":"What’s our purpose at Vincent? Moments of Excitement. All made possible by our flavor, innovation and, most importantly, by unlocking potential in our team members.",
        "detail3":"With more than 50 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to best serve our customers through tried and true service principles. Instead of following trends, we set them. We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile. No matter where you find us, we’re making sure each meal our customers enjoy is delicious and one-of-a-kind.",
        "detail4":"Vincent was one of the first restaurants I discovered upon moving to New York last summer, and it remains a favorite. Despite its sizable menu full of pastas, sandwiches, and pizzas, I almost always get the same thing – the Vincent pizza. It’s made with Ricotta & Marinara sauces, spiced with oregano, and topped with eggplant, red onions, basil, Pecorino Romano & Mozzarella. It really is one of the best pizzas I’ve ever had – and I eat a lot of pizza.",
        "detail5":"The pizza is delicious! The crust is thin and crispy, great sauce, and awesome cheese blend. And it makes a cute cheap date!"
